# Inventory-Management-System
allows you to create, update, and keep track of an inventory system.
There is still an issue with the code. It asks "Do you want add a product,
update quantities, or display the inventory" twice. Have not been able to 
fix this issue yet.
I have also include a "DEBUG_CODE" preprocess directive. You can uncomment
this to see this inventory and its changes each time you input something.
